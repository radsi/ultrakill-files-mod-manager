It is a third party program, so you don't have to do anything with the game files, although I recommend you to have a backup of the original files, in case you want to remove the mods

You just have to install the program and the mods, if the mod is an installer just make a copy of ULTRAKILL_Data and install it there, when you install it copy the files that have been modified and add them to the mod folder

EACH MOD HAS TO HAVE ITS OWN FOLDER (the name of its folder doesn't matter), and if a vanilla file is inside a folder, the mod file also has to be in a folder WITH THE SAME NAME

If the mod requires a file that doesn't exist in the vanilla archives, don't worry, just put it in the mod folder


The program requires 2 parameters, the path of the ULTRAKILL_Data folder and the path of the folder where you are going to save your mods

To load a mod just select the mod and press the apply button

The game has to be closed or restarted when a mod is to be/has been installed
